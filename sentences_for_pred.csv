\Spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning.
But sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty?
"Nobody should love that.\\ - Lucius Shepard<br /><br />\\""The Color Purple\\"" takes place in the Deep South during the early 1900sand tells the story of Celie and Nettietwo African American sisters."
The film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowersan idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather.
This motif  innocence interrupted by men  permeates the entire film.<br /><br />The film then launches into a series of short sequences.
Celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfathergives birth in a dirty barnhas her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named Albert Johnsona violent oaf who rapes her repeatedlyforcing her to cookclean and look after his children.<br /><br />All these horrific scenes are given little screen timeand are instead surrounded by moments of pixie-dust cinematographya meddlesome symphonic scoreincongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work.
"The cumulative effect is like the merging of a Disney cartoon and a rape moviea jarring aesthetic which caused Stanley Kubrick to remark that \\""The Color Purple\\"" made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes."
Ten minutes?
"He lasted a long time.<br /><br />The film is often said to deal which \\""racism\\""\\""sexism\\"" and \\""black culture\\""but this is not true."
Alice Walkerthe author of the novel upon which the film is basedclaims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian.
Her book is a lesbian fantasya story of female liberation and self-discoverywhich paints men as violent brutes who stymie women.
For Walkerthe only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopiablack sisterhood and female independence celebrated.<br /><br />Spielberg's filmhoweverre-frames Walker's story through the lens of comforting American mythologies.
This is a film in which the salvific power of Christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men.
A film in which Albert finds himself in various ridiculous situationsmoments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool.
A film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel showsthe cast comprised of lecherous men (always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins)stereotypical fat mammiesjazz bands and gospel choirs.
<br /><br />This is a film in which black people are naturally childlikereadily and happily accepting their social conditions.
A film in which black people are over-sexedcarnal sensualists dominated by violent passions.
A film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible (Albert lives in a huge house) and black men are completely inept.
"This is not the Old Souththis is the Old South as derived from \\""Gone With The Wind\\""MGM Muscals\\""Song of the South\\""Warner Cartoons\\""Halleluha!\\"" and banned Disney movies."
In other wordsit's the South as seen by a child raised on 50s TV.
It's all so cartoonishso racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypesthat black novelist Ishmael Reed famously likened it to a Nazi conspiracy.<br /><br />Of coursein typical Spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed.
This reconciliation was in Walker's novelbut Spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin.<br /><br />Beyond Walker's hate letter to black men and Spielberg's bizarre caricaturing of black lifewe are shown nothing of the black community.
We have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community.
"InsteadSpielberg's camera jumps aboutdesperately fighting for our attention (one of Celie's kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a \\""Home Alone\\"" movie)every emotion over playedthe director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by."
"Couple this with Quincy Jones' ridiculously \\""white\\"" musicand you have one of the strangest films in cinema history: an angry feminist tract filmed by a white Jew in the style of Disney and Griffithscored by a black man trying to emulate John Williams.<br /><br />Problematic too is the lack of white characters."
Consider this: the men in this film aren't portrayed as being rough to each othernor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood.
Nothey are cruel by nature.
And the womenwhether quietly suffering like Celie or rebellious and tough like her sisterpersevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them.
A better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressedratherit would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abusethat enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts (whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles) and that African American domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factorswomen unable to support themselves and their children alone.<br /><br />And so there's a hidden ideology at work here.
Late in the film one character tells another that since he didn't respect his wifeshe wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites.
The implication is that blacks need to return to their African roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them.
ie- Respect one another in your poor minority community and you won't run afoul of the dominant white culture.

I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP's.
And this one surely is an OOP.
"One year after The Exorcist she's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of Blair never broke out, she never became a mega star."
That's one of the reason's many of her films are OOP.
She gives a good performance in this movie.
It's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn't have any friends.
"Played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14, that's funny."
The movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity.
"In most editions it's cut out, why, I don't know, no blood is involved, okay, Blair is butt naked but nothing is shown, no T&A so nothing to offend people."
"But the movie is slow, extremely slow."
It doesn't happy normally to me but I almost felt asleep.
"It's just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows, no gore no nothing."
Why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me.
"If you're a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is."
"There's enough star power in THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS to create another galaxy, yet the final product is pretty debatable."
"The film and its messages are very noble, and I think perhaps most would agree with them."
"(Liberal Democracy good, violent fascist regime bad; open-mindedness good, racism bad, etc)."
"Unfortunately, we're battered from head to toe with these, and as much subtlety is used as I've described them."
"<br /><br />Ultimately, we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities."
It radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated \pro\\ wrestling match.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons plays the patrona man of many contradictions.
Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Closeas her sister in law.
When the camera stays with these folksthe movie tends to moveand is quite enjoyable.
UnfortunatelyTHE HOUSE OF SPIRITS engages with simply way too many subplotsand characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets.
We don't get to know themhence we don't get to care for them.
The result is boredom.
<br /><br />If Bille Augustthe director and screenwriter (from Isabel Allende's book) had either lengthened the film or snipped a few charactersthis film might have worked completely.
"As it standsit was a nice trywith nice messagesand a bonecrushing yawnfest.<br /><br />Not recommended.\"""
- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap.
"Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \The Twilight Zone\\."
The flashbacks are pretty much useless.
One part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better.
I wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the actingeven from the adults was horrid.
A kissing scene in this movie even sucked.
This movie killed the book.
The book was great.
I highly do not recommend this movie.
Not even for educational purposes.
<br /><br />- Good Stuff: I don't know what I can say really.
There is some suspense parts that get you goingbut they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting.
"<br /><br />- My Verdict: Do not watch.\"""
I would like to say that unlike many of the people who disliked this film and found it impossible to understand I was fully able to understand it for what it is..
A very incoherent attempt at a plot line.<br /><br />I don't like to toss this word around but in this case it fits very well.
The director firstly presents the material in an extremely \arrogant\\ way and worseextremely incoherently.
It is incoherent in that it presents the material in a messy dislodged ordermaking us think that the director was too drunk to remember which scenes come firstand arrogant in that at 2 hours long they expect usthe viewer to CARE by the end of it.<br /><br />I respect surrealist cinema for what it is.
(creating a story around a more than real world that does not tie to real life) But there is nothing surreal about having a story placed in ordinary modern timesand a modern day earth settingthat is most importantly not able to engage the audience but furthermoresimply a dislodged series of events that barely tie together.
The most accurate way to describe the experience of viewing this film is like viewing a story; perhaps even a very GOOD story as it was based on a bookbut being frustrated by the fact that the camera doesn't seem to capture the necessary moments and tie together any means of coherence.<br /><br />Let's compare stylistic cinema.
"Compare Gaspar Noe's \\""Seul contre tous\\"" to this."
He gave us a coherentextremely engaging and intellectually deep story.
This movie offers no intellectual studyand while it is very stylistic in it's fragmented presentationthe director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely tie in together.<br /><br />Yes indeed it IS possible to make sense of things....
to a POINT.
"But as i said earlier the viewer will reach a stage where they simply say \\""Who cares.\\"" It plays out like watching a drab mundane story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in uncronological order."
Even with murders it is completely uninteresting and unengaging.
Too many people these days will give high marks to something they are unable to understand or make sense of simply for fear of looking foolishand in every way this film TRIES to make the viewer look foolish.<br /><br />If you have too much time on your handsthen please watch this filmtaking into account what I have said of it.
"It is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a MUCH more effective way and that is my bottom line reasoning.\"""
Love Jones is one of the best movies I've experienced.
<br /><br />The main element that sticks out to me is the fact that it is very well-directed.
"I have studied this film in it's entirety - with watching movies more than once, certain things dawn on you subconsciously - the direction of this movie, as well as the writing, is chic, hip, and artful! I am in love with the direction."
The scene where Larenz Tate and Nia Long are riding the motorcycle through north Chicago at night is astonishing.
The director of this movie DESERVED awards for his great job.<br /><br />Love Jones is a classy and sexy film.
"It highlights the fact that we can be people who love, who have flaws, who love living, learning, and just being us without the hype."
"Being our Natural selves.<br /><br />The poetry is wonderful, but the story line, the dialog, and the scenes really make this movie.<br /><br />This movie deserves to be seen."
"It is a great movie for lovers and friends to sit back and watch, or, the hopeless romantic (like myself) to sit back and enjoy alone on a Friday or Saturday night."
"Any day of the week where peace, solitude, and a little entertainment is needed, Love Jones is what I recommend."
It's a mistake to refer to any film of this era as a horror film.
Most early German films with supernatural themes are not so much horror films as they are dark fantasies borrowed from the works of early German Romantics like E.
T.
A.
Hoffman and others.
In Fritz Lang's \Der Mude Tod\\ (also from 1921) Death personified takes a young man away from his sweetheartbut in Lang's film the characters' destiny cannot be mitigated by behavior.
"Neither of the young lovers deserves to diebut they are destined by circumstances to be reunited only in death.<br /><br />In Victor Seastrom's \\""Korkarlen\\"" howeverrepentance is always an option."
Destiny can be altered - and death deferred - through the characters' choices.
Although scenes of the Phantom Carriage collecting souls are genuinely eeriethese horrific images of Death as the great leveler are compromised by Death's offer of redemption to the real monster of this taleDavid Holma brutal drunk whobecause of a perverse hatred of humanityspreads tuberculosis and emotional misery to everyone he comes in contact with.<br /><br />One New Year's Eve Holm is struck down in a fight with a drinking companion.
As the first person to die on the stroke of midnight Holm must become the driver of the Phantom Carriage and collect souls during the new year.
The Phantom Carriagedriven by an old acquaintance who had started Holm on his road to ruincomes for his soul and takes him on a journey of self discovery.
Along the way Holm sees the horror he has inflicted on his family and the people who tried to help him.<br /><br />Perhaps my disappointment with the film's ending is a criticism of the Selma Lagerlöf novel on which the film is based.
But I would have preferred to see David Holm unable to escape his destinyand to see his repentance come too late to prevent his wife from poisoning his two children and herselfand to see Holm suffer for the consequences of his sins by being made to collect their souls.
It would have been a fitting punishment and a horror more immense than witnessing the abuse he inflicted on others.
In the filmhoweverthe unalterable nature of destiny isn't the message; redemption is.
The driver of the carriage allows Holm's spirit to return to his bodyand he rescues his family in the nick of time.
"His repentance smacks of Scrooge's repentance in \\""A Christmas Carol.\\"" <br /><br />If the trite and sentimental ending does not offend youthere is still much to admire in the film's images."
The special effects are astonishing when measured by the standards of the dayand still hold upwhich is more miraculous when you consider that these double exposures were created inside a hand-cranked camera.
"Alsothe restored film on Tartan's new DVD looks fabulous.\"""
Alistair Simms is a wonder in this.
He makes such a good headmistress.
The role given here for George Cole was made for him.
"Hence, the casting job on this film was perfect."
I think it was one of those rare occasions where everything clicked.
"the story line was good, the comic dialogue a scream and the older prefect girls a delight!! Each character you are endeared to, even the villains."
Why can't we make films like this any more.
"Basically, this is a very English comedy with good movement and fluidity."
It is a great movie.
i sow that some people think that this might not be based on a true story.
"No matter this !!, the movie is great, and all u can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends up flying in the mermaid town and so on, instead thinking that \a little girl's wish came true\\and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in usand do all in this world to make them true."
The little girl (Desi - in the movie)and her momwere the best actors i've been seen in a long time.
Good for theyfor all actorsall for the director.
"If someone can tell them thisplease tell them\\""A 25 year guy from Romania says thank you for making this movie\\"".\"""
"I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I was always enamored of Ms. Hayworth's looks, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />This may be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms. Hayworth."
"She's never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of 'Gilda', where she is sex symbol par excellence).<br /><br />Rita is more than ably assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers."
"The comedy may be dated, but it is still quite amusing."
"Kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances, dancing with the image of himself from a window.<br /><br />But Rita drives this whole movie."
"An excellent cast, featuring Otto Kruger and the always- wonderful, wise-cracking Eve Arden doesn't hurt.<br /><br />Rita sings, Rita dances, all the while looking impossibly beautiful! The music may be short of classic, but the lyrics to most of the tunes are quite clever.<br /><br />I find this movie works better than 'Gilda', which I regard as a flawed film."
"To Ms. Hayworth's credit, she also drives 'Gilda', and Gilda drives any red-blooded male insane.<br /><br />The film holds up well after all these years."
Much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus!
